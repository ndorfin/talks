## Many web platform APIs working together

At its core, a 'Web Component' is the combination of the following:

- An ES class that extends the built-in `HTMLElement` class,
- That is then tied to markup via a 'Custom Element' (and other ways)

Extended or improved with these optional technologies:

- `<template>` elements
- Using the Shadow DOM
- ES Modules

These technologies help too:

- HTTP/2+ multiplexing / streaming
- CSS Custom Properties
