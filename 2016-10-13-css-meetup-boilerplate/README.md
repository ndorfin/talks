On the [13th of October 2016](http://www.meetup.com/WellingtonCSS/events/234261922/) I spoke at the [Wellington CSS Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/WellingtonCSS/) on the topic of boilerplates we use in Front-end Development.

This repo contains:

- the slides in [.xd](slides.xd) (6MB) and [.pdf](slides.pdf) (73MB) formats, as well as
- a [transcript](transcript.md), and
- supporting [code examples](code).
