Hello!

# Peter F. Hamilton's Second Chance at Eden

Any Sci-fi fans in the house?

Has anyone here read this book? It's a collection of Science Fiction short stories, written by Peter F. Hamilton, dating back to 1991.

Hamilton was a prolific science fiction writer, and these short stories were set in his Night's Dawn universe.

The main story in the book, 'A Second Chance at Eden', was set inside a giant compound asteroid, somewhere around the 27th Century. A bio-engineered organism had for hundreds of years burrowed inside the asteroid, cosuming the asteroid's contents for materials and energy, creating a habitable ecosystem for the organism's occupants: Edenists.

Edenists are highly-evolved and telephathically connected humans living in a Utopian Society. After an Edenist is born they learn to interact with Eden itself, and all their peers with their natural telepahtic links. When they die, their consciousness passes onto the central organism. Eden is therefore both distinct from and the collective of its occupants.

Eden provides:

- sustenance
- connectedness
- the source of truth
- collective memory
- permanence for its occupants

Do you see where I'm going with this? Why does that sound familiar?

# What other incredible things happened in the nineties?

- Well, there was Dolly The Sheep. She was the first cloned mammal!
- And, we started the Human Genome Project, mapping DNA in humans.
- The Hubble Space Telescope was launched!
- GPS came online
- And those nerdy scientists at CERN launched The World Wide Web.

Now you may be asking, 'Shaun, what is the world wide web?' I'm so glad you asked. That's why we're here, right?

It's…

 - A series of tubes
 - A human right,
 - A connecting force, but also a polarising force
 - The repository of all human knowledge
 - Whatever our imaginations can conceive

…And each one of you get to work on it, play with it, teach it.

Let's re-examine. Our asteroid is Earth. Eden is the Internet. It provides vital sustenance in the form of online fast food, online shopping. It connects us and our shared thoughts. It stores all of our shared memories and is a source of truth or 'facts', but most importantly, it's an outlet for our desired permanence. The Internet doesn't forget.

We have 500 years until we reach Hamilton's fictional date for Eden. At the risk of sounding like a prophet, I think we'll get there sooner.

Phew, OK. Let's drop the analogies for now, and set a little context for your future on the web.

# Let's examine a few trends.

- The rise in computing power, Moore's Law. Computers are getting smaller, and faster.
- The eveready evergreen browsers. Browser vendors are updating their browsers more often.
- New technology incorporated in browsers every week, browsers improve in efficiency and speed
- Browsers incorporated in new technology every week, more reliance on the internet.
- The decline of software. The Cloud allows us to store things online. Think about how word processing is done these days, or spreadsheets for that matter.
- Machine learning principles and AI are being used more and more.
- Automation is starting to affect every industry
- More interfaces to work with. VR now. Visual cortex and auditory implants are the next wave. Soon: Neural interfaces.

What does that mean?

- A whole new generation of User Interfaces
- Browsers will be everywhere
- The Web will get richer with higher fidelity 'media'. Think Volumetric Video.
- The Web will permeate our lives even further
- We'll be more reliant on the Web

What does that mean for you?

- We'll need some of you to help design the User Interfaces
- Globalisation will increase, and you'll help shape that
- There'll be plenty of work for now. Software will be one of the last industries to be made obsolete
- You'll be in the centre of a Human Rights campaign

So, what are you next steps?

 - You're here! That's great!
 - You can learn from other websites
 - You can learn on the Web
 - You can learn from others on the Web

Web Development, and to a degree, web design, is a vast spectrum of roles.

If you have any affinities with…

 - Art
 - Language
 - Sociology
 - Psychology
 - Law
 - Engineering

…you'll find a niche in the web. So don't get dissuaded if your programming skills aren't up to scratch. We need wordsmiths as much as we need neckbeard programmers.

And on the topic of coding, a web developer is more than just a coder.
A good web developer writes good code, but a great web developer is a considerate, ego-less and responsible team player.

A great website is one that:
 - can be crawled by robots
 - can be used by people with visual or learning impairments
 - work on any device with a browser
 - are tested before launch
 - are efficient and speedy
 - are reliable
 - and many more

Some inspiration:
 - WebVR
 - WebAudio
 - Geolocation
 - App-like experiences
   - Offline capabilities
   - Push Notifications
